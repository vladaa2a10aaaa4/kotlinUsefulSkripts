A collection of **educational Kotlin scripts** that I write while learning the language.

This project is a personal learning space for **Kotlin**.  
Here you can find simple scripts and exercises that cover:

- Variables and data types
- Functions
- Control flow (`if`, `when`, loops)

The repository grows as I learn new concepts.
